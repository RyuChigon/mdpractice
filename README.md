- Final Team Name: Cheers


- Problem statement

Due to the current pandemic situation, the cheering culture which is an important part of sports has disappeared and lots of sports people have missed it.


- Problem background

Along with the history of sports, the culture of sports fans and cheering cannot be separated from each other. Intense sports fans would come to the stadium and cheer their teams intensely, and the cheering culture itself has developed to contain diverse contents such as cheerleading, songs, etc. The sense of unity and teamwork people feel when they are cheering for the same team in the stadium is unique and enjoyable. But due to the COVID-19, sports fans cannot enjoy such a passionate atmosphere online. This situation not only makes players feel less encouraged because they can’t see their fans cheering directly, but also fans miss Cheering Culture. According to the following pie chart, when watching live sports on television during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US of 2020, 43% of people are less enjoyable without fans and 10% of people are more enjoyable without fans. It supports the idea that there are significant needs for people who want to interact with others during watching live sports shows. Also, one of our members, Chigon is a fan of KIA Tigers, Korean baseball Team and often went to the baseball stadium with his friends before COVID-19. By cheering for his team, he enjoyed games and relieved lots of stress. Sadly, he couldn’t visit the stadium after COVID-19. Watching and cheering games alone is less exciting and Chigon doesn’t watch baseball games as often. He wants to watch sports games and cheer for our team together as if we are in the stadium. If there is a program that can bring out the same excitement and feeling of unity online as if being in the actual stadium, such dissatisfaction will be released.


- Motivation

Cheering culture between sports fans requires a feeling of unity and takes a simple but thorough form of teamwork. Such interactions could not be felt due to the limitations brought by Covid 19, but the aspect of social computing which can create diverse interactions and catch the context between people can replicate such experiences online. The feeling of unity and excitement from interactions requires lots of people to participate actively, which cannot be duplicated by a machine or individual expertise.
